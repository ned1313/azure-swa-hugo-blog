Owl Kitty is a YouTube celebrity cat and certainly improves the acting skills in this film!

Most of her videos are based on famous films, with behind-the-scenes greenscreen videos to show how these are painstakingly made.

Lizzy (stage name: OwlKitty) is a two year-old cat living in Portland, Oregon. She stars in all your favorite movies and tv shows and gets lots of treats and cuddles in return. Offscreen, Lizzy loves her laser pointer, her adoptive mother (a 10 year-old tabby) and the taste of cream cheese. Sheâ€™s never caught a bird.

So far, OwlKitty has made appearances in such classics as Star Wars, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, How to Train your Dragon, The Shining, Titanic, 50 Shades of Gray and Risky Business. You can also find her in Game of Thrones, The Lion king and Stranger Things
